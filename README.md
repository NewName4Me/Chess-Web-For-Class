#### Conclusion

In conclusion, the main points outlined in this document highlight the importance and impact of implementing efficient strategies and solutions. By focusing on these essential aspects, teams can improve performance, enhance collaboration, and drive successful outcomes.

```python
# A simple Python script to display the initial setup of a chess board

def create_chess_board():
    # Setting up pieces using standard chess notation
    pieces = ['R', 'N', 'B', 'Q', 'K', 'B', 'N', 'R']
    pawns = ['P'] * 8
    empty_row = [' '] * 8

    board = [
        pieces,               # Black major pieces
        pawns,                # Black pawns
        empty_row[:],         # Empty row
        empty_row[:],         # Empty row
        empty_row[:],         # Empty row
        empty_row[:],         # Empty row
        pawns,                # White pawns
        pieces                # White major pieces
    ]

    # Display the board
    for row in board:
        print(' '.join(row))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    create_chess_board()
```

This code initializes a simple representation of a chess board and prints the initial setup using standard chess notation with major pieces and pawns for both black and white. You can run this Python script to see the starting position of a chess game.
